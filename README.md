# KNXSync

KNXSync allows you to easily control HomeAssistant entites from your KNX bus and to publish their states to it.

This integration is in development and anything might change at any time.
Therefore there are no installation instructions here.
Either you know how to install this and can accept the consequences of it potentially blowing up your HA instance or you are not the target audience yet.

## Requirements

A working KNX integration.

## Supported entity domains

The following domains are currently supported:

- Light (on/off, brightness, RGB color)
- Climate (current and target temperature, HVAC operation mode)
- Binary sensor (UI for native knx exposure)

## How to use

1. Install the integration
2. Add it to your integrations from the UI. You only need to add it once.
3. Configure it and follow the steps.
